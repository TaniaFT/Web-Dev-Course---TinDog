# The Complete Web Development Bootcamp - TinDog

Following Angela Yu's Udemy course, this is one of a variety of website projects created through the course.

Learning Bootstrap and responsive design, to create a 'tinder for dogs' style website. Made mostly as a follow-the-tutorial site, with some learning and flexibility within it.
